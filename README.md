# -Fuzzy-Adaptive-RRT-N-Path-Planning-for-Autonomous-Vehicles-CARLA-
Implements FA-RRTN, a fuzzy logic-enhanced RRT variant, to optimize path planning in dynamic environments. Integrates with CARLA for simulation, achieving 84% faster computation, 68% fewer nodes, and shorter paths (6.57m vs. 7.01m) vs. RRT*. Built in Python with CARLA, NumPy, and fuzzy logic.
